## Aim of experiment
The IV characteristics of a PN junction diode experiment is to analyze the current-voltage relationship of the diode under both forward and reverse bias conditions. Specifically, this experiment aims to:

*   Determine the threshold voltage at which the diode begins to conduct in the forward direction.
*   Observe and record the exponential increase in current with increasing forward voltage.
*   Measure the leakage current in the reverse bias condition.
*   Identify the breakdown voltage where significant current flows in the reverse direction.
*   Understand the practical implications of the diode's IV characteristics in electronic circuit design and analysis. Through this experiment, students and professionals will reinforce their understanding of the theoretical concepts governing diode operation.
